### ☁️ About Me

> I am a **Cloud Engineer** passionate about building infrastructure that is reliable by design and secure by default.

Grounded in strong technical fundamentals—including **Linux administration**, **networking**, and **SQL**—I specialize in translating complex requirements into scalable AWS architectures. I believe that great infrastructure should be invisible; when I do my job well, your systems simply run faster, safer, and more efficiently.

#### 🎯 My Core Focus

* **Production-First Mindset:** Designing for high availability and fault tolerance from day one.
* **Precision Engineering:** Automating the "boring stuff" to focus on optimization and innovation.
* **Root Cause Solving:** Viewing every challenge as an opportunity to architect a better long-term solution.
